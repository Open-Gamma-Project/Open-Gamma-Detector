**For a reference 3D model, you can have a look at the `3D` folder. It contains some `mtl` and `obj` files if you want to design your own enclosure.**

# Parts List

Here are all the parts you need to build all the different 3D printed enclosures. These are all compatible with the Open Gamma Detector Rev. 2, 3 and 4.

The case is designed to fit a scintillator with a maximum size of 5 x 5 x 5 cm. The USB connection will be extended to the outside via a short USB panel mount cable.

You can have a look at all the different designs by uploading them to [ViewSTL](https://www.viewstl.com/).

All of the design work has been done by WEDBox, [box@wed.ch](mailto:box@wed.ch), many thanks!
